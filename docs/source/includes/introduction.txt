Overview
========

Django-audiofield is a Django application which allows audio file upload and conversion to mp3, wav and ogg format.
It also makes it easy to play the audio files into your django application, for this we integrated a HTML5 and Flash audio player 'SoundManager2'

The goal of this project is to quickly manage audio files into your django project and make it easy for admins and users to listen to them.

Add the following lines in your models.py file::

    from django.conf import settings
    from audiofield.fields import AudioField
    import os.path

    # Add the audio field to your model
    audio_file = AudioField(upload_to='your/upload/dir', blank=True,
                            ext_whitelist=(".mp3", ".wav", ".ogg"),
                            help_text=("Allowed type - .mp3, .wav, .ogg"))

    # Add this method to your model
    def audio_file_player(self):
        """audio player tag for admin"""
        if self.audio_file:
            file_url = settings.MEDIA_URL + str(self.audio_file)
            player_string = '<audio src="%s" controls>Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio>' % (file_url)
            return player_string
    audio_file_player.allow_tags = True
    audio_file_player.short_description = _('Audio file player')


Add the following lines in your admin.py::

    from your_app.models import your_model_name

    # add 'audio_file_player' tag to your admin view
    list_display = (..., 'audio_file_player', ...)
    actions = ['custom_delete_selected']

    def custom_delete_selected(self, request, queryset):
        #custom delete code
        n = queryset.count()
        for i in queryset:
            if i.audio_file:
                if os.path.exists(i.audio_file.path):
                    os.remove(i.audio_file.path)
            i.delete()
        self.message_user(request, _("Successfully deleted %d audio files.") % n)
    custom_delete_selected.short_description = "Delete selected items"

    def get_actions(self, request):
        actions = super(AudioFileAdmin, self).get_actions(request)
        del actions['delete_selected']
        return actions


If you are not using the installation script, please copy following template file to your template directory::

    cp audiofield/templates/common_audiofield.html /path/to/your/templates/directory/

    {% block extrahead %}
    {{ block.super }}
        {% include "common_audiofield.html" %}
    {% endblock %}
